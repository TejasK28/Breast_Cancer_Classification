# Breast Cancer Classification

## Tools:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- Support Vector Machines

## Objective:
- Train and optimize a simple Support vector machine model to classify the results of labeled training data of breast cancer inputs with 30 features, and train it against the remainder of the dataset
- Optimization includes a grid search to find the best `C` and `Gamma` parameters to penalize misclassification and focus on points near the boundary respectively

## Results:
- Trained and optimized model reuslted in a 98% accurancy, 98% precision, and 98% recall score
